# DailyCodeChallenge
Sometimes a little bit of prectice is required, so alogn with my friends and teammates [Kary-AG](https://github.com/Kary-AG) and [Ui Chul Shin](https://github.com/shucshin) I'm solving one problem daily to earn a little of skill in order to get better at programming.

And well, because _why not?_
